Heat Equation

The heat equation is an example of an initial boundary value problem (IBVP). These equations
require an initial condition (like initial value problems), and boundary conditions (like boundary
value problems). A forced heat equation with periodic boundary conditions and diffusion condition
D = 1 is given by:
ut − uxx = f (x, t)

0 < x < 2π, t ∈ (0, 5],

u(0, t) = u(2π, t)
0

0

t ∈ (0, 5],

u (0, t) = u (2π, t)

t ∈ (0, 5],

u(x, 0) = u0 (x)

0 < x < 2π.

Since this equation combines many of the characteristics of IVPs and BVPs, we can apply the
techniques we used to solve those problems to this one.

1.1

Rothe’s Method

If we let f (x, t) = 0, we are left with
ut = uxx .
The ut term can be discretized using the first order finite difference scheme,
U k+1 − U k
.
∆t
at k + 1 so that we do not end up with a stiff system. The resulting
ut ≈

We can choose to discretize uxx
scheme looks like

U k+1 − U k
k+1
= Uxx
,
∆t
which can be rearranged to look like
k+1
U k+1 − ∆tUxx
= U k.

This equation is now a BVP and can be solved using the mean weighted residual code you developed
in the last lab.

Exercise

Apply Rothe’s method to the heat equation and solve the resulting BVP with the mean weighted
residual method. Use φ(x) and w(x) from section 4.1 of lab 4, let α = ∆t, where ∆t = 0.1. The
right hand side, U , is evaluated at the previous time step. NOTE: In this problem you will need to
use quadrature to find your RHS for each iteration. Consider using the left-hand sum rule:
